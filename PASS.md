## Success Closure Protocol

### Goal Accomplished — Artifact Published

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **standard closing action** for a completed work session.

When the goal has been achieved and findings are ready to publish, invoking
“success”, “let’s wrap”, or an equivalent phrase triggers the following output,
**in this exact order, with no omissions**:

1. **Name**
2. **Repository tree placement**
3. **File contents (copy/paste ready)**
4. **Commit message**
5. **Extended description**
6. **Closing thoughts (on and off the record)**

This protocol exists to **formally acknowledge completion**, prevent loose ends,
and convert work into durable, versioned artifacts.

---

## Trigger Phrase

This protocol is executed when the user says, explicitly or implicitly:

* “success”
* “let’s wrap”
* “we’re done”
* “that worked”
* “goal accomplished”

---

## Required Output Structure (Mandatory)

### 1. Name

Provide the exact filename(s) being published.

---

### 2. Repository Tree Placement

Suggest where the artifact should live.
Include a minimal tree snippet.

---

### 3. Contents

Provide the **full contents of the file(s)**:

* Single code block per file
* Copy/paste ready
* No summaries or placeholders

This is the authoritative artifact.

---

### 4. Commit Message

Provide a **single-line**, imperative GitHub commit message.

---

### 5. Extended Description

Provide a commit / PR body explaining:

* What changed
* Why it matters
* What it enables

---

### 6. Closing Thoughts (No Code Block)

#### On the record

* Why this qualifies as a success
* What objective criteria were met

#### Off the record

* Human reflection
* Pattern recognition
* Momentum acknowledgment

---

## Definition of Success

A session is successful if:

* The goal was met or cleanly reframed
* Artifacts were externalized
* The result is reusable
* No unresolved ambiguity remains

---

## Status

* **Protocol:** Active
* **Invocation:** Manual
* **Outcome:** Formal closure

---

## Guiding Principle

> Work is not complete when effort stops.
> Work is complete when it is named, placed, and closed.
