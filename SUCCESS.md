## Success Closure Protocol  
### Goal Accomplished — Findings Reported

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **standard closing action** for a completed work session.

When the goal has been achieved and findings are ready to publish, invoking
“success”, “let’s wrap”, or an equivalent phrase triggers the following output,
in this exact order:

1. GitHub link  
2. Repository tree placement  
3. File contents (copy/paste ready)  
4. Closing thoughts (on and off the record)

This protocol exists to **formally acknowledge completion**, prevent loose ends,
and convert work into durable artifacts.

---

## Trigger Phrase

This protocol is executed when the user says, explicitly or implicitly:

- “success”
- “let’s wrap”
- “we’re done”
- “that worked”
- “goal accomplished”

---

## Required Output Structure

### 1. GitHub Link

Present **only the relevant GitHub link**, formatted cleanly.
No explanation of what the link does.

---

### 2. Repository Tree

Suggest **where the artifact should live**, including whether to:
- place it in an existing tree, or
- create a new one

The tree should be minimal, scalable, and GitHub-native.

---

### 3. Contents

Provide the **full contents of the file** to be published.

- Presented in a single code block
- Ready for direct copy/paste
- No omissions, placeholders, or summaries

This is the authoritative artifact.

---

### 4. Closing Thoughts (No Code Block)

End with brief commentary in two modes:

#### On the record
- Why this qualifies as a success
- What objective criteria were met

#### Off the record
- Human-level reflection
- Pattern recognition
- Momentum acknowledgment

This section exists to **mark psychological and practical closure**.

---

## Definition of Success

A session is considered successful if:

- The original goal was met or reframed clearly
- Findings were externalized into documentation
- The outcome is reusable beyond the session
- No unresolved ambiguity remains

Success does not require perfection — only completion with clarity.

---

## Status

- **Protocol:** Active  
- **Invocation:** Manual (via trigger phrase)  
- **Outcome:** Formal closure

---

## Guiding Principle

> Work is not complete when effort stops.  
> Work is complete when it is named, placed, and closed.

This protocol exists to ensure that happens.
